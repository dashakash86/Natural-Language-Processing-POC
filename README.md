POC using Natural Language Processing to build a Customer Rating Prediction system

About the Data:
We will use the [Yelp Review Data Set from Kaggle]
Each observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user. The "stars" column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review. The "cool" column is the number of "cool" votes this review received from other Yelp users.
All reviews start with 0 "cool" votes, and there is no limit to how many "cool" votes a review can receive. In other words, it is a rating of the review itself, not a rating of the business. The "useful" and "funny" columns are similar to the "cool" column.

Goal of our POC:
We'll try to process the reviews text data, using Natural Language Processing to see how we can read sentiments and then predict a business rating based on customer's voice or review
